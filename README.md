# 🚨 Undershell: Women’s Safety Redefined

> Empowering Women. Assisting Police. Enabling Response.

Undershell is a proactive women’s safety platform that bridges the critical gap between distress and response. By combining real-time alerts, hardware support, voice-activated triggers, and signal-less communication, Undershell ensures no woman is ever alone in danger — even when offline.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

> 💬 _“Only 5.2% of women facing physical/sexual violence seek police help. 99.1% of cases go unreported.”_

Today’s safety systems are **reactive**, not **responsive**. Delays in reporting incidents leave women vulnerable and hinder effective law enforcement.
